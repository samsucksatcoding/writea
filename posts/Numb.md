# Numb
## A poem by ellie
---
Here I stand, numb,
Injured and broken.
Stuck in this slum,
Wishing I’d stayed unspoken.

Still here I remain,
Lost in the haze,
The exit feels distant,
My thoughts out of place.

But I’ve made it this far,
That alone is proof—
Anyone can be a star
When they fight for their truth.

# Numb
## A poem by ellie
---
Here I stand, numb,
Injured and broken.
Stuck in this slum,
Wishing I’d stayed unspoken.

Still here I remain,
Lost in the haze,
The exit feels distant,
My thoughts out of place.

But I’ve made it this far,
That alone is proof—
Anyone can be a star
When they fight for their truth.
---
You are someone.
You matter more than you think.

Look at how far you’ve come—
and how much further you still can go.

There is more waiting for you than what hurts right now.
People care about you, even from a distance.

You don’t have to carry everything alone—
you just have to let someone know when you need them.
